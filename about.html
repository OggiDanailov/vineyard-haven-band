<div class='aboutUs'>
<p>Established in 1868, the Vineyard Haven Band is the oldest continuous, nonprofit cultural organization on Martha's Vineyard, an island off the coast of Cape Cod. We carry on the 19th-century "band in the park" tradition with a repertory of American classics - military marches, patriotic tunes, traditional songs, and contemporary and popular fare.</p>

<p>Our 15 core musicians and 20-odd seasonal players represent all ages, occupations, and affiliations; many are year-round residents, others are students or summer visitors. Our music director, Julie Schilling, is a clarinetist and longtime music teacher in the Martha's Vineyard schools, and is married to the second-longest-serving Band member, trumpeter John Schilling.</p>

<p>The Band unites every summer to entertain Islanders with free concerts. We perform every Sunday night during July and August, alternating between Owen Park, on the harbor in Vineyard Haven, and the gazebo in Ocean Park, Oak Bluffs. The Band also plays for island summer events including Illumination Night, the 4th of July, and summer fireworks.</p>
