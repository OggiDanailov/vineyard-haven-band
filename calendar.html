		<h2 class='concerts'>Coming Concerts</h2>
		<p>
			All of our concerts are free and open to the public. We perform every Sunday evening at 8 p.m. from the beginning of July through the third week of August, as well as for special events throughout the summer.

Sunday concerts alternate weeks between Vineyard Haven, at the bandshell in Owen Park, and Oak Bluffs, in the Ocean Park gazebo. Audience members are encouraged to bring chairs or blankets for the lawn seating. 

In case of rain, Vineyard Haven concerts are rescheduled for Monday night; Oak Bluffs concerts are moved indoors to the Tabernacle.

The band traditionally performs a July 4th concert after the parade at the Old Whaling Church in Edgartown; at Illumination Night in the Oak Bluffs Tabernacle; and for the Oak Bluffs August fireworks.</p>
