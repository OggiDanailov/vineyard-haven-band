	<h1 class='aboutVineyard'> ABOUT THE VINEYARD HAVEN BAND</h1>

	<div class='aboutText'>
	<p class='text'>
	Established in 1868, the Vineyard Haven Band is the oldest continuous, nonprofit cultural organization on Martha&#39s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Cape Cod. We carry on the 19th-century "band in the park" tradition with a repertory of American classics - military marches, patriotic tunes, traditional songs, and contemporary and popular fare.

	Our 15 core musicians and 20-odd seasonal players represent all ages, occupations, and affiliations; many are year-round residents, others are students or summer visitors. 
	
	The Band unites every summer to entertain Islanders with free concerts. We perform every Sunday night during July and August, alternating between Owen Park, on the harbor in Vineyard Haven, and the gazebo in Ocean Park, Oak Bluffs. The Band also plays for island summer events including Illumination Night, the 4th of July, and summer fireworks. </p>

	<p class='text'>
	All of our concerts are free and open to the public. We perform every Sunday evening at 8 p.m. from the beginning of July through the third week of August, as well as for special events throughout the summer.
	
	Sunday concerts alternate weeks between Vineyard Haven, at the bandshell in Owen Park, and Oak Bluffs, in the Ocean Park gazebo. Audience members are encouraged to bring chairs or blankets for the lawn seating. 
	
	In case of rain, Vineyard Haven concerts are rescheduled for Monday night; Oak Bluffs concerts are moved indoors to the Tabernacle.

	The band traditionally performs a July 4th concert after the parade at the Old Whaling Church in Edgartown; at Illumination Night in the Oak Bluffs Tabernacle; and for the Oak Bluffs August fireworks.</p>
